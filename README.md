# Turbo C <conio.h>
Back to the Future!

## For Windows, Linux & macOS
This library implements the "must haves" from the classic Turbo C conio.h. 

Kudos to [Thiago Adams](https://github.com/thradams/conio) for taking this one off of my life's bucket list!

## Original documentation:
Yes, today more than ever before most must know that `devolution` is a real threat? 

Here is [the way we were](http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/radstudio2007/RS2007_helpupdates/HUpdate4/EN/html/devwin32/coniohpart_xml.html).

## Updates
After contributing to the upstream, wanteeded (want + needed =) to add a few expere'mentals:

(1) Support for cygwin64

(2) Multi-platform Makefile

(3) Cache / recall default colors

Will be part of my new educational opportunity - stay tuned!
